# Favorite CPSC 120L Labs 

* Lab 1

    I enjoyed lab 1 because it was my very first class on computer science. I learned my first program "Hello World!". And it was the start of my entire computer science journey.

* Lab 10 

    I enjoyed using the 2D vectors this was a turning point for my understanding of computer science. In the past I would look at the code and wonder what was happening, but this lab is where that all changed. For the first time I was able to comprehend what I was writing and it gave me a new boost in myself that I was capable of coding. 


* Lab 12 

    I use all of my previously learned knowledge to create an image. I enjoyed this lab because it is the end of my intro to computer science. It is a bittersweet feeling but it is the start of many new and exciting opportunities.
